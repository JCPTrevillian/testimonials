                 <p>"I was admittedly nervous about having oral surgery but the staff made me comfortable with what to expect so I felt well informed and prepared on the day of my appointment. They answered all of my questions as well as helped me understand pain and pain management after my procedure."</p>

                 <p>"I had a consultation years ago and recently scheduled another one to see if maybe I could get the work done since I had time off from work. Not only did they remember me, we had the second consult without repeating what I already knew from my first consult. Surgery mornings in this office are what their long standing reputation is built on."</p>

                 <p>"Emergency surgery - same day consultation and procedure. They made my appointment work with their schedule because I was in so much pain. Everyone was really nice and I felt well cared for in my worst time of need. The insurance was handled so I paid very little out of pocket.‚Äù</p>
