                <p>"I was admittedly nervous about having oral surgery but the staff made me comfortable with what to expect 
                so I felt well informed and prepared on the day of my appointment. They answered all of my questions as 
                well as helped me understand pain and pain management after my procedure. My only regret is I waited so long!"</p>

                <p>"I had a consultation years ago and recently scheduled another one to see if maybe I 
                    could get the work done since I had time off from work. Not only did they remember me, 
                    we had the second consult without repeating what I already knew from my first consult. 
                    Surgery mornings in this office are what their long standing reputation is built on."</p>

                    Everyone coordinated the timing of my treatment plans, insruance payments, etc. I am satisfied with my 
                    result. I recommend!"</p>

                    I was in so much pain. Everyone was really nice and I felt well cared for in my worst time of need. The insurance 
                    was handled so I paid very little out of pocket."</p>
